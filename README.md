# Text Generator 🔗

Generates a random yet syntactically plausible-ish and meaningful-ish text using Markov chains and a bit of luck. Sometimes outputs “wise thoughts”™

## Try Yourself! 👨‍💻

Open the [app](https://bespoyasov.ru/showcase/text-generator/browser/) in the browser and upload a .txt file with a text that will be used as the source for word predictions. The more words this text contains the better, more than 100k is perfect.

Or try in the console:

```py
echo 'have idea have ikea!' > sample.txt
python3 -m cli --word-count=50 --sample-size=3 sample.txt
```

## How it works 🛠

The generator uses Markov chains to randomly choose a word based on previously generated words. More info about Markov chains, how text generation works, and how to create one of these generators:
